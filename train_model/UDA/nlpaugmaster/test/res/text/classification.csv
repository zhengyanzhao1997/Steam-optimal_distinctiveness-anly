"My hope lay in Jack's promise that he would keep a bright light burning in the upper story to guide me on my course. On a clear night this light was visible from the village, but somehow or other I failed to take into account the state of the weather. The air was full of eddying flakes, which would render the headlight of a locomotive invisible a hundred yards distant. Strange that this important fact never occurred to me until I was fully a fourth of a mile from the village. Then, after looking in vain for the beacon light, the danger of my situation struck me, and I halted.I am certain to go wrong","LABEL_0"
"Dotty continued to go to Mrs. Gray's every night with the milk. Sometimes Katie went with her, and then they always paused a while under the acorn-tree and played. Dotty said she wished they could ever remember to bring their nipperkins, for in that case the milk would taste a great deal more like nectar.","LABEL_1"
"It was a bright and cheerful scene that greeted the eyes of Captain Raymond and his son as they entered the parlor of the adjacent cottage. It was strictly a family gathering, yet the room was quite full. Mr. Dinsmore was there with his wife, his daughter Elsie and her children, Edward and Zoe, Elsie Leland with her husband and babe, Violet Raymond with her husband's two little girls, Lulu and Grace, and lastly Rosie and Walter. Everybody had a kindly greeting for the captain, and Violet's bright face grew still brighter as she made room for him on the sofa by her side.","LABEL_0"
"Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells. Cell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle. In eukaryotes, there are two distinct types of cell division: a vegetative division, whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell (mitosis), and a reproductive cell division, whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce haploid gametes (meiosis).","LABEL_2"
"Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another. Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes.","LABEL_1"
"To explain transitivity, let us look first at a totally different example that has a lot to do with transitivity but nothing to do with rationality. A combination of choices is rational if an observer can deduce someone else's preferences (that is, learn what that person likes best, medium, and least) just by observing his choices. Suppose I put your friends Adam and Ben side-by-side and I see that Adam is taller than Ben. Then I put Ben and Charlie side-by-side and I see that Ben is taller than Charlie. Can you tell me who is taller, Adam or Charlie? Adam, of course. How do we know? We simply use transitivity: if Adam is taller than Ben, and Ben is taller than Charlie, then Adam is taller than Charlie. This also means that I can rank your three friends by their height: from tallest (Adam) to shortest (Charlie).","LABEL_2"
